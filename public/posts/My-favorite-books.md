As a developer, continuous learning and self-improvement are essential. This list explores books that have significantly impacted my journey, both in coding skills and overall well-being. Whether you're a coding novice or a seasoned developer, I believe these reads offer valuable insights.

## Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)

Huge thanks to my friend [Khoa Huá»³nh](https://github.com/khoahuynhdev) for introducing me to this legendary text during our university days.

This book, also known as SICP or the Wizard Book, ignited my passion for learning functional programming. It's a challenging textbook used at MIT that requires decent math skills, but I believe it can be rewarding for anyone interested in becoming a better programmer or software engineer. 

If you're up for the challenge, I recommend reading the Lisp version and supplementing it with the MIT 6.001 Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, Spring 1986 lectures.

## Meditations
Thank you my friend [Cameron](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-chardukian/) for opening my eyes to Stoicism through this book.

Life can be incredibly difficult, but Stoicism teaches us a valuable lesson: focus on what you can control. You may not be able to choose what life throws your way, but you can choose your response. Even when faced with challenging circumstances, it's possible to enjoy life and find happiness. 

As Marcus Aurelius, the Roman emperor himself wrote, *"When you arise in the morning think of what a privilege it is to be alive, to think, to enjoy, to love...".*

## The Passionate Programmer

In my opinion, becoming a programmer shouldn't be driven by the desire for wealth or fame. True enjoyment comes from passion! Passion, I believe, is one of the most crucial aspects for success and fulfillment as a programmer or software engineer.

## The Saint, the Surfer, and the CEO

While I don't often read self-help books, it's not because I dislike them. Instead, I find that many offer perspectives on life that I already agree with and enjoy. 

This particular book, however, stood out. It taught me valuable lessons about love, authentic interactions, and savoring life's experiences. It's like a new lens that's helped me see the world in a fresh, enriching way.
