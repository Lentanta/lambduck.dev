## Hello this is my first post

Well, this is my fist post and I'm writing it in English. For me, English is a hard language to learn. Not because it bad or hard, language is just a tool but you have to learn the rule and using correctly. English is like Javascript.

Javascript is not a good programming language compare to others languages. But It used for web development for a long time.

### What do I think about this world?

I don't know, this world is just beautiful and pain as the same time. As a software engineer and a human being, I still don't know how this world work, how to deal with people and how to learn to accept what you cannot get in this world.
